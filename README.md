## Driver boards

### 20629, 20938, 21020 "251 CONTROL"

Unlike the earlier ST-225 and ST-412 generations, drives with this board use 5-phase steppers and can seek nearly twice as fast as the ST-412. A lot of discrete logic and analog circuitry has been integrated into several LSI chips.

The PCB schematic and layout for 20629 are available, see st251/20629. This board is used in the ST-251 (plain).

The PCB schematic and layout for 20938 are available, see st251/20938. This board is used in the ST-251-1 as well as the ST-277R (-300 version).

The PCB schematic and layout for 21020 are available, see st251/21020. This board is used in the ST-277R-1.


**20629 to 20938 changes**

Changes to the stepper motor circuits:

* The L293 bridge chips have been replaced with custom drivers (11721-501).
* Another custom chip, the 11743-501, has been added to control the enable state of each stepper phase.
* The DC\_UNSAFE# signal has been split and no longer controls the stepper motor enable. A new RETRACT# signal, generated by the 10223-502 chip's power good monitoring comparators, does this instead. (DC\_UNSAFE# is generated by power good comparators in the 10206-501 read/write circuit.)
* The stepper sequencer output enable (pin 3) is now driven by the RETRACT# signal instead of being pulled up.
* The stepper sequencer has been moved from the regular 5V rail to the spindown keepalive rail (+5VP).
* The stepper driver chips now get 5V from the regular 5V rail instead of a filtered rail (+5F).
* The ring detector LSI has had a jumper installed in series with the reset input (not populated by default)
* 1K series resistors have been added between the stepper windings and the ring detector LSI.
* The digitally-controlled stepper motor voltage rail now has more bulk capacitance (C63, with series resistor for stability).

Changes affecting the spindle motor drive circuit:

* The spindle motor driver, the speed control LSI (11692-502) and the index comparator LM339 have been combined in a single custom spindle driver IC, the 11791.
* The braking bridge rectifier (UC3610) has been removed and two additional MOSFETs have been added for braking.

Changes affecting the read/write circuit:

* The read/write head center tap driver filter now gets power from the regular 5V rail instead of sharing it with the stepper driver chips.
* Write termination resistor R21 has been moved to be near 11E (the receive side) for signal integrity.

Some changes imply changes to the drive firmware. This means that firmware meant for the previous revision will no longer work on this board:

* The MCU has been swapped with a mask ROM chip (80118-502) and the EPROM and address latch (6B) are no longer populated
* The MCU port PA7 is now tied through a resistor (R33) to ground. It no longer drives the stepper motor ALL\_PHASES\_ON signal. Presumably newer firmware can check for this strapping resistor to detect which board revision it's running on.
* The ALL\_PHASES\_ON signal is now driven by bit 7 of the external IO port (the 'LS273).
* The INDEX\_SYNC# signal to sync up the hall state machine is now triggered by the output port 'LS273 bit 0 instead of being triggered by a write to 0x0105.
* A write to 0x0105 now pulses the stepper sequencer 7C RESET# pin (14), instead of it being controlled by bit 0 of the output port 'LS273.
* The MCU port PB4 no longer goes to the debug test points. Instead, it's been routed (along with PB5 and PB6) to the new 11743-501 stepper phase control chip inputs S1, S2, and S3.

**20938 to 21020 changes**

The electrical changes here are fairly minor. The layout has some moderate changes to improve routing and add the (few) new parts.

* The spindle motor driver IC is now the 11738-002 which has a slightly different package.
* The spindle motor IC's reference resistor now has two possible values, set by a transistor driven by a toggle flip flop (1F section A) by writing to address 0x0106. The default is 13K (19.6K || 38.3K) and, when toggled, it is just 38.3K. Presumably this is for power savings during operation by running the spindle motor at a reduced current.
* The MCU has a new part number, 80118-505. Presumably this is new firmware that knows how to reduce the spindle driver power.
* The MCU's clock crystal is now just a single through-hole footprint instead of a dual SMT/PTH one.
* The steering diode IC is now the 10189-502 (not the 10189-521).
* The H-bridge enable controller is now the 11468 instead of the 11743-501.

## Firmware

The firmware from the 20629 board has been dumped. The label is marked "ST 251 / LSIL18". The firwmare has been fed through Ghidra and a good chunk of it has been commented and labeled. See [the repository](st251/firmware/ST251_commented.txt). Some parts of it are not understood.

**Functional Description**

Several signals are simply buffered to the MFM bus and active only when the drive select line is valid:

* DRV\_SEL\_OUT#
* READY\_OUT#
* TRK0\_OUT#
* WRT\_FAULT\_OUT#
* INDEX\_OUT#
* SEEK\_COMPLETE#

Other signals are returned from the MFM bus only when the drive select line is valid:

* STEP#
* DIR#

The INDEX\_OUT# signal is passed through a one-shot timer run off the HALL input divided by two. On every other HALL pulse, it goes low for about 1213 cycles of the CLK input. This is about 600us. The INDEX\_SYNC# signal, when held low, prevents the INDEX\_OUT# signal from asserting. On the rising edge of INDEX\_SYNC#, the HALL input divider is resynchronized and the first pulse on HALL will generate an index output pulse. The second pulse is skipped, but the third makes it through, and so forth.

The WRT\_FAULT\_OUT# is the WRT\_FAULT# input but delayed by 6 clock cycles.

The stepper direction signal going into the MCU is a latched version of the one present on the MFM bus, latched when STEP is pulsed.

There is an SR latch driving the SEEK\_COMPLETE# signal. This signal deasserts when STEP# asserts, RESET# asserts, or DC\_UNSAFE# asserts. It asserts when the MCU\_SEEK\_DONE# signal asserts.

The INDEX\_TRACK# signal is somewhat complex. The internal circuit isn't well understood but it looks at the data coming from the read channel and detects a special signal recorded on track -2. This is "2F" or 00101111 which occurs, repeating for 4ms, at the index location. The rest of the track contains a 1.75MHz signal which does not trigger this pin. For CLK=2MHz, this pin seems to go low when READ\_DATA falls between 1.958MHz and 2.038MHz.

The INDEX\_TRACK# signal seems to depend on internal counters. If READ\_DATA pulses at least once per CLK high/low, in 9 READ\_DATA pulses, then INDEX\_TRACK# asserts low on the 9th READ\_DATA rising edge. This triggers another one-shot device that ensures that INDEX\_TRACK# continues to be asserted for 5 rising CLK edges after READ\_DATA stops pulsing. DC\_UNSAFE# resets both the READ\_DATA pulse detector and the INDEX\_TRACK# one-shot.


### 10188-501 "SSI257.2"

This device drives the center tap connections of the R/W heads, and also provides two outputs to drive the write current resistor divider.

**Pin Description**

| 14  | IWR2    | Output    | Write current output drive 2. |

**Functional Description**

The center tap driver chip drives the center tap of each head coil depending on the head select input state. During a write fault
(WRT\_FAULT\_IN = 1) all heads are deselected.

| WRT\_FAULT\_IN  | HDSEL4# | HDSEL2# | HDSEL1# | HDC1 | HDC2 | HDC3 | HDC4 | HDC5 | HDC6 |

|               0 |       1 |       1 |       0 |   VT | VCTAP|   VT |   VT |   VT |   VT |
|               0 |       1 |       0 |       1 |   VT |   VT | VCTAP|   VT |   VT |   VT |
|               0 |       1 |       0 |       0 |   VT |   VT |   VT | VCTAP|   VT |   VT |

(VT is 0.86 * VHS. VCTAP in the table is actually VCTAP - 0.25V.)

Unselected heads are driven to VHS * 0.86. There may be an internal voltage divider but this is buffered with a low (0.3 ohm) impedance driver before being switched onto the head output.

The voltage provided to VCTAP must be higher than the voltage provided to VHS.

The chip also includes a very simple two-transistor driver for the write current selection. This is used for up to 4-zone recording.

When RIWR1 is driven high, IWR1 is driven to +12V. Otherwise, IWR1 floats.
When RIWR2 is driven high, IWR2 is driven to +12V. Otherwise, IWR2 floats.

**Functional Description**

The currently selected read/write head has the common (center tap) winding brought to a voltage higher than the center tap windings
of all the other heads. This forward biases internal steering diodes, while reverse biasing the internal diodes connected to deselected heads.

A differential signal placed on the DI inputs appears on the connection of the currently selected head. This is used to write track data. Leave the inputs high to avoid writing data--an output only sinks current when a DI input sinks current.

Differential signals from the currently selected read/write head gets amplified by the internal read preamp and driven out to the DO outputs. A gain network (R, C, or RLC) can be attached to the two GAIN pins. Lower impedances increase the gain, as shown approximately in this table.

|  R  | Gain |
|-----|------|
| 10K | 24   |
|  1K | 28   |
| 100 | 40   |

The preamp is similar to the NE592 video amplifier chip. See the datasheet for examples of different gain networks. Typically a capacitor is used here to create a differentiator (high pass) function. This aids the peak detection function in the read channel (see the next section.)

**Detailed Description**

The write drive circuit takes differential digital data from the WDATA\_IN pins and outputs it (with a current set by the WRITE\_CUR pin) on the WDO pins during write mode. Write mode is entered when DC\_UNSAFE# is deasserted, WRT\_OK is asserted, and WRT\_GATE# is asserted (DRV\_SEL# is ignored).

VHS senses when the voltage in the heads exceeds a limit of about 3.5V, and when this happens, WRT\_FAULT# asserts.

VCTAP is driven to 12V in write mode and otherwise goes to 5.3V. It is controlled by WRT\_GATE# alone, for some reason.

The power supply monitor asserts DC\_UNSAFE# when the 5V rail falls below 4.2V (rising threshold is 4.23) or when the 12V rail falls below 9.54V (rising threshold is 9.67V).

The preamp section is very similar to the NE592. A RLC network is typically connected across the gain terminals to provide a bandpass filter characteristic. This shapes the differentiated signal coming from the head preamp (located in the head matrix IC).

Typically the circuit on the drive logic board splits this diffential output signal into two sets of signals with different filters applied. Each set of signals has a differential comparator input that each drives a one-shot timer.

Comparator C1 drives one-shot TMG1. Comparator C2 drives one-shot TMG2, and TMG2 drives TMG3. In order to generate an output pulse, the logic is not well understood but it seems that comparator C1 must trigger after comparator C2 (due to an external phase shift network).

If the conditions are met to generate an output pulse, the fourth one-shot trigger, TMG4, triggers for its fixed pulse width time.

![Raw waveforms of each one-shot pin](photos/10206-501-one-shot.png)

Each one-shot pin works in stages:

1. The pin is pulled up to (mostly) 5V. This discharges the timing capacitor tied between the pin and 5V.
2. The pin is released and allowed to discharge through the external pulldown resistor to 90% of 5V. This triggers the output of the one-shot. By using the narrow threshold (only 10% of the total RC curve) the timing result is approximately linear.
3. Some pins discharge the timing capacitor again to 5V, others hover at the 90% of 5V mark.

The timing value can be approximated as T = 0.1 * R * C.

In the scope shot above, all the pins have had 10K resistors installed and the following capacitor values

* Pin 32: 270pF
* Pin 33: 470pF
* Pin 34: 680pF
* Pin 35: 2200pF

These are much larger than the usual values used by the hard drive, which is typically 47pF, to make the scope shot easier to interpret.

Typical values (on the ST-251) are:

* TMG1: 82ns - comparator C1
* TMG2: 47ns
* TMG3: 69ns - total time for comparator C2 is 116ns
* TMG4: 42ns - output data pulse width

**Detailed Description**

The power driver chips for the stepper motor phase windings are typically L293 or similar totem-pole devices. That means that each phase connection can be driven high or low depending on the input state, but the output driver can also be disabled so it pulls neither high nor low. However, the step sequencer chip, 11782-501, can only drive both phase outputs (+ and -) low to indicate that the driver should be disabled. If both coil drivers are driven low, the coil is effectively short-circuited and will brake the motor, so this chip detects that and disables both coil drivers.

If the ALLON line is low, then each phase output enable EN\_x will track the corresponding + and - inputs by XORing them together. So if both inputs are low or both are high, then the phase output enable will go low. If one input is high and the other is low, then the phase output enable goes high.

If the ALLON line is high, then all phase output enables go high regardless of the motor phase inputs.

The output mask select mux inputs, S1, S2, and S3, can selectively force individual phase output enables low according to this table:

| S3 | S2 | S1 | EN\_A | EN\_B | EN\_C | EN\_D | EN\_E |
|----|----|----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |       |       |       |       |       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |       |       |       |  low  |       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |       |  low  |       |       |       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  low  |  low  |       |       |       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  low  |       |       |       |       |
|  1 |  0 |  1 |       |       |       |       |  low  |
|  1 |  1 |  0 |       |       |  low  |       |       |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  low  |       |  low  |       |       |

Empty boxes follow the state prescribed by the ALLON line and the +/- motor phase inputs.

Typical firmware leaves all three select mux inputs low, but one section brings S1 high, possible for stepper motor voltage calibration.

| 7   | DRV   | Open drain | Spindle brake MOSFET driver output. Normally pulled low, this pin goes high impedance when power fails and the timer expires. |
| 13  | GND   | Ground | Connect to ground. |

**Functional Description**

This device monitors the 5V and 12V input pins. When either pin falls below their respective undervoltage thresholds, this begins retraction mode.
The retract pin asserts low and the motor winding drivers activate, driving either high, low, or high impedance depending on the 5-phase step table.
The step speed is controlled by the clock input, typically tied to one of the coils on the spindle motor. The input has a 2-level comparator,
requiring a signal amplitude that falls below 2.5V and rises above 3.6V.

When retraction mode is entered, the CT pin gets driven with a 10uA current source so the capacitor begins to charge. Once it reaches 2.44V, the MOSFET brake driver pin
goes from the low state to the high impedance state. External pullup circuitry then drives the brake MOSFETs to stop the spindle motion.

Calculate the delay time as T = C * 2.44V/10e-6. Using a 6.8uF capacitor, the delay time is about 1.66s. This is the amount of time given to allow the stepper motor
to retract the heads up against the hard stop before the spindle brake is activated.

The step sequence is as follows:

| Phase | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| MOTA+ | z   | z   | z   | H   | H   |
| MOTA- | z   | z   | z   | L   | L   |
| MOTD+ | z   | H   | H   | z   | z   |
| MOTD- | z   | L   | L   | z   | z   |
| MOTE+ | H   | H   | z   | z   | H   |
| MOTE- | L   | L   | z   | z   | L   |

This is designed for a 5-phase stepper motor (10 wire) but it does not drive phases B and C.

**Functional Description**

The device has a linear regulator with a 7-bit DAC controlling the voltage. The topology is simple. The output voltage is monitored by an external resistor divider tied to FB and compared directly with the VREF input. The error amplifier output connects to the COMP pin for external compensation purposes. The DRV pin is inverted and connects to an external PNP pass transistor (or an arrangement of an NPN and a PNP).

Communications to the device occurs over a simple 8-bit SPI bus (no data output). Deassert the active-low CS# line and clock data, LSB first, into the device (CLK normally high, rising edge triggered), then release CS#. The data format is as follows:

| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| 1 | n | n | n | n | n | n | n | Update DAC with the code n. |
| 0 | x | x | x | x | m | m | m | Update the ring mux selector with code m. x bits are ignored. |

The built-in DAC is a 7-bit device that drives a voltage from 0 to VREF/2 onto the DAC\_SET pin. An external resistor connected to ground turns this into a current that is drawn from the FB pin. The higher this current, the more the output voltage increases.

The nominal output voltage is Vref * (1 + Rtop/Rbot). With the values in the ST-251 schematic, this is 3.75V, assuming the DAC is set to 0.

The DAC increases the output voltage by Rtop * (VDAC / RDAC\_SET). VDAC is just (n/127) * (VREF/2). For example, a DAC code of 0x2A results in a DAC output voltage of 0.413V. Using the values in the ST-251 schematic, this is a current of 255uA pulled from the FB node. With an upper resistor of 10K, this corresponds with a voltage increase of 2.55V. The total output voltage is then 6.3V.

The ring detector is a window comparator that examines one of five possible differential inputs, A-E. The input is selected using the SPI bus with the MSB set to 1 and the value 0-4 loaded into the LSBs.

The window threshold is controlled by the voltage applied to the RING\_SET pin. It seems to be a percentage of that voltage. The output of the window comparator goes to a digitally-timed counter state machine which is incompletely understood but clocked by the SYS\_CLK input. The output of this is passed along to the RING\_DET output (which must be pulled up externally). In typical operation, this pin toggles on every edge of the ringing signal generated by the back EMF of the stepper motor winding.
