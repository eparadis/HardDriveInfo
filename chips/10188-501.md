## Functional Description

The center tap driver chip drives the center tap of each head coil depending on the head select input state. During a write fault
(WRT\_FAULT\_IN = 1) all heads are deselected.

(VCTAP in the table is actually VCTAP - 0.25V.)

Unselected heads are driven to VHS * 0.86. There may be an internal voltage divider but this is buffered with a low (0.3 ohm) impedance driver before being switched onto the head output.

VHS (Voltage Head Safe) uses a resistor network to aggregate the voltages on all the head center tap connections. The adjacent read/write channel LSI monitors this voltage with comparators. If the voltage is too high, that indicates that multiple heads have been selected for writing, which triggers a write fault. A voltage that is too low indicates that no heads are selected for writing, which also triggers a write fault.

The chip also includes a very simple two-transistor driver for the write current selection. This is used for up to 4-zone recording.

When RIWR1 is driven high, IWR1 is driven to +12V. Otherwise, IWR1 floats.
When RIWR2 is driven high, IWR2 is driven to +12V. Otherwise, IWR2 floats.
