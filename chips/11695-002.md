# 11695-002 "SPEED CONTROL"

This custom LSI chip controls and regulates the speed of the spindle motor. It seems to be nearly identical to the SSI 32M5901.

## Function Description

This device generates commutated coil output control signals based on the hall effect sensor input. It regulates the speed by measuring the hall effect input against the 2MHz input reference clock frequency. The device assumes that there are two hall pulses per revolution and that the motor is to be regulated to 3600 RPM, or 120 hall pulses per second.

The device also monitors the number of reference clock pulses, and if hall effect pulses aren't received for a certain number of cycles, both COILA and COILB outputs are disabled (locked rotor protection).

The sense input is externally tied to a current sense resistor in series with the ground path of the driver transistors. The chip cuts off the COILA/COILB signal early when the current reaches a set limit.

When the 12V power supply falls below a threshold, the motor coil back EMF causes the COILA and COILB inputs to turn on simultaneously, braking the motor.
