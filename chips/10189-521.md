## Functional Description

The currently selected read/write head has the common (center tap) winding brought to a voltage higher than the center tap windings
of all the other heads. This forward biases internal steering diodes, while reverse biasing the internal diodes connected to deselected heads.

A differential signal placed on the DI inputs appears on the connection of the currently selected head. This is used to write track data. Leave the inputs high to avoid writing data--an output only sinks current when a DI input sinks current.

Differential signals from the currently selected read/write head gets amplified by the internal read preamp and driven out to the DO outputs. A gain network (R, C, or RLC) can be attached to the two GAIN pins. Lower impedances increase the gain, as shown approximately in this table.

|  R  | Gain |
|-----|------|
| 10K | 24   |
|  1K | 28   |
| 100 | 40   |

The preamp is similar to the NE592 video amplifier chip. See the datasheet for examples of different gain networks. Typically a capacitor is used here to create a differentiator (high pass) function. This aids the peak detection function in the read channel (see the next section.)
