# SSI 280 Read channel and write preamplifier

This device incorporates the read channel and the write amplifier circuitry.

## Pin Description

| Pin | Name | Direction | Description |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|
| 28  |  12V  | Power In  | 12V power rail. |
| 19  |  5V   | Power In  | 5V power rail. |
| 5, 20 | GND   | Ground    | Connect to ground. |
| 10  | WRT\_OK | Input   | Write OK input. Assert when seek completed, ready, and drive selected. |
| 11  | WRITE\_CUR |      | Write current set point. |
| 12  | WDO+  | Output    | Data out to the head steering matrix (positive) |
| 13  | WDO-  | Output    | Data out to the head steering matrix (negative) |
| 15  | WDATA\_IN+ | Input | Write data in (positive) |
| 16  | WDATA\_IN- | Input | Write data in (negative) |
| 23  | WRT\_GATE# | Input | Active low write enable. Connect to MFM bus. |
| 24  | WRT\_FAULT# | Output | Active low write fault indicator. Asserted if a fault occurs during a write, may deassert during reads. |
| 25  | DC\_UNSAFE# | Output | Active low DC unsafe indicator. Asserts if 5V or 12V rail fall below minimum thresholds. |
| 26  | VHS   | Input     | Voltage Head Safe. Monitoring connection to the head steering matrix. |
| 27  | VCTAP | Output    | Voltage Center Tap. Head center tap driver; driven to 12V during a write and about 5.3V during a read. |
| 1   | DI+   | Input     | Preamp signal input (positive). |
| 2   | DI-   | Input     | Preamp signal input (negative). |
| 3   | -GAIN |           | Preamp gain pin 1. |
| 4   | +GAIN |           | Preamp gain pin 2. |
| 6   | DO+   | Output    | Preamp signal output (positive). |
| 7   | DO-   | Output    | Preamp signal output (negative). |
| 8   | +C    | Input     | Signal comparator input+. |
| 9   | -C    | Input     | Signal comparator input-. |
| 14  | DRV\_SEL | Input  | Active low drive select input. Enables the read channel differential outputs. |
| 21  | +RDO  | O.C.      | Single-ended open-collector read data output. |
| 17  | +RD   | Output    | Digital data output (positive). |
| 18  | -RD   | Output    | Digital data output (negative). |
| 22  | TMG1  |           | One-shot timer RC pin. |

The functionality of this device is similar to the 10206-501 but with a simpler pulse generation section including a single one-shot.
