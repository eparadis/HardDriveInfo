## Functional Description

This device monitors the 5V and 12V input pins. When either pin falls below their respective undervoltage thresholds, this begins retraction mode.
The retract pin asserts low and the motor winding drivers activate, driving either high, low, or high impedance depending on the 5-phase step table.
The step speed is controlled by the clock input, typically tied to one of the coils on the spindle motor. The input has a 2-level comparator,
requiring a signal amplitude that falls below 2.5V and rises above 3.6V.

When retraction mode is entered, the CT pin gets driven with a 10uA current source so the capacitor begins to charge. Once it reaches 2.44V, the MOSFET brake driver pin
goes from the low state to the high impedance state. External pullup circuitry then drives the brake MOSFETs to stop the spindle motion.

Calculate the delay time as T = C * 2.44V/10e-6. Using a 6.8uF capacitor, the delay time is about 1.66s. This is the amount of time given to allow the stepper motor
to retract the heads up against the hard stop before the spindle brake is activated.

The step sequence is as follows:

| Phase | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| MOTA+ | z   | z   | z   | H   | H   |
| MOTA- | z   | z   | z   | L   | L   |
| MOTD+ | z   | H   | H   | z   | z   |
| MOTD- | z   | L   | L   | z   | z   |
| MOTE+ | H   | H   | z   | z   | H   |
| MOTE- | L   | L   | z   | z   | L   |

This is designed for a 5-phase stepper motor (10 wire) but it does not drive phases B and C.
