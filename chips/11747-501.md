## Functional Description

This device is the hall effect divider and the low-side 5-phase stepper motor driver.

### Hall Effect Divider

A pulse train from the spindle motor hall effect sensors is fed into HALL\_IN. This signal gets divided by 2 or by 4 depending on the state of pin FOUR/TWO# and output on the INDEX\_OUT pin. To synchronize the output signal, pulse CLEAR# low to clear the internal counter. The INDEX\_OUT, when triggered, generates a one-shot pulse that has a width of 64 cycles of the CLK input pin.

### Low-Side 5-Phase Stepper Motor Driver

Five output pins, MOTA#, MOTB#, MOTC#, MOTD#, and MOTE# are either left floating or driven low (when active). They are driven by internal latches. All five latches are cleared (outputs are high-Z) by pulsing CLEAR# low.

To control an individual latch, first select the latch by loading a value from 0-4 on the MUX0, MUX1, and MUX2 pins. Then pulse the MLATCH pin high. This will set this particular motor latch (if one or more of the SET1-5 bits are high) or clear this motor latch (if all the SET1-5 bits are low). The set state means that the motor output will drive low, and the clear state means that the motor output goes high impedance.

| MUX2 | MUX1 | MUX0 | Motor Latch |
|------|------|------|-------------|
|    0 |    0 |    0 |       MOTC# |
|    0 |    0 |    1 |       MOTD# |
|    0 |    1 |    0 |       MOTA# |
|    0 |    1 |    1 |       MOTB# |
|    1 |    X |    X |       MOTE# |


Some motor latches are exclusive. Trying to set one low and then the second one low causes the first one to get cleared back to hi-z.

* MOTC# and MOTD# can't both be low. 
* MOTA# and MOTB# can't both be low.

Therefore you can have up to three pins low at once, MOTE#, and one of MOTA#/MOTB# and MOTC#/MOTD# pins.

To set the drive current while a motor phase driver pin is low, connect a resistor from the ISET pin to ground. The typical value is 10K. This pin drives the voltage across the resistor to approximately 1.28V. The drive current is proportional to the current flowing in the resistor. At 10K, this is about 32mA.
