## Functional Description

This IC includes build-in power driver transistors as well as a step table and counter for 4-phase stepper motors.

Std: Standard step mode (1/2STEP=0, MODE=x, DIR=0)

Half: Half step mode (1/2STEP=1, MODE=0, DIR=0)

AltHalf: Alternate half step mode (1/2STEP=1, MODE=1, DIR=0)

When DIR = 1, the phase is decremented and goes in reverse order (right to left) on the table.

| PH3 | H | H | H | H | L | L | L | H |

(Z means the phase is floating, not driven high or low.)

The SET pin must be connected with a resistor (around 50K) to ground to bias up the chip. If it is pulled high or left floating, then the chip will not drive any of the outputs and the internal phase counter will be reset to phase 0.
